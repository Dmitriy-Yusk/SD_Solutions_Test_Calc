Implementation

Backend - FastAPI:
- api/v1/calculate - supports Core Operations
- api/v2/calculate - supports Additional Operations and Complex Expressions, including operations ordering, (), power, logarithm and sqrt
- api/v3/calculate - the same calculations as in v2 but result is formatted to provide result coloring

Note: A little bit another color schema is used.

Frontend - Bootstrap and Vue3.js
There re two modes in the calculator:
- Basic, where calculation for Core Operations are available, v1 endpoint is used
- Extended, Additional Operations and Complex Expressions can be calculated.
  In this mode v2 endpoint is used if "Color result" not checked and v3 if it checked.

Calculator Challenge

Overview

This challenge involves creating a web-based calculator application that parforms basic arithmetic operations. The focus is on a robust design that separates business logic from presentation, and is extendable for future
enhancements,

Functional Requirements
1. Core Operations: The calculator must support addition (+), subtraction (=), division (4), and multiplication [*).
2. Client-side Input Format: It takes an operator and two operands as inputs.

94 + 58 = 152

3. REST API Integration: All operations and their results should be accessible via a REST APL.
4, Server-Side Logic: The business logic, including calculations and result processing, must be implemented an the server side
5. Client-Side Presentation: The client-side application should handle only the presentation aspects and interact with the server using AJAX/REST API
6. Multi-Application Support: The REST API should be designed to accommodate multiple client applications without requiring changes to the API contract.

Design and Implementation Standards
1. OOP/0O0D Principles: The application should adhere to Object-Oriented Programming and Design principles
2. Extensibility: Design the application to be open for extensions but closed for madifications (Open/Closed Principle]. This means the core code shouldn't need changes for future extensions.
3. Future Extensions (For Design Consideration Only):
	- Additional Operations (e.g. exponentiation - x~y),
	- Complex Expressions (eg. a + b â€” e/d + x*d).
	- Varied Result Formats:
		- Simple Numeric Result (e.g. {result:5}).
		- Numeric Result with Calor Coding (e.g. {result:5, color:'red'} ). Color determination is based on the result number's parity (even: green, odd: red).
		Warning - I changed the coloring, RED is used for errors, like division by zero. For EVEN I use PURPLE, for ODD - BLUE
	- The design should account for these potential extensions without implementing them at this stage.

Bonus Challenge: Implement an algorithm that organizes the operators and operands in a specific order.

Implementation Notes
	Ensure that the API and server-side logic are robust and efficient.
	The client-side should be user-friendly and interact seamlessly with the server.

This challange is an opportunity to demonstrate your skills in software design, RESTful API development, and client-server architecture.
